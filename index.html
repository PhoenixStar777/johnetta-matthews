					<h1>Hi. I'm Johnetta Matthews!</h1>
					<p>I'd like to formally introduce myself. I'll share more on what I do professionally and leisurely so you can verify if I have the skills you are seek.</p>
                    <p>My first introduction into web development involved static HTML websites, Google Adwords campaigns, Adsense, Facebook Ad Campaigns, and Search Engine Optimization.  Later,
					   I discovered the importance of blogging and email campaigns to keep close contact with all leads that were generated.  My first lesson was seeing the importance of
					   marketing, user-friendly website layouts. With all of this experience, now I'm on my way to becoming a junior developer.  </p>
					<p>My goal is to work for a company that will allow for me to demonstrate web development skills and create for the needs of the company using JavaScript, Node JS, REACT,
						Postgres and more.  I'm currently enrolled at Thinkful in the Software Engineering Immersion program to become a full stack developer.

    <!-- About me -->

      <h2 id="about">About me</h2>
      <div class="group">
	   <div class="item item-double">
          <p>On a professional note, I've had a career of training, organizing, and supervising people.  My largest highlight has been, serving as a Director of Marketing and Public Affairs for the Air Force.  I trained and guided personnel in four counties in Southern California and the entire state of Arizona.  I strongly believe I've proven myself as a people person.</p>  
		  <p>Later, I stumbled into the Virtual World Environment and realized, I enjoyed creating game assets, working with Linden Scripting Language, and graphic design.  The virtual format introduced me to coding and I've been hooked ever since.  My goal is to be a creator of applications, websites, or work as a team player to create what a company desires.  Contact me and lets create together.</p>

          <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy technology within a 3D virtual environment. The technologies I enjoy are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UKGgXz0CpQ&ab_channel=PhoenixAnkaa" target="_blank">building and scripting motorcycles</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UKGgXz0CpQ&ab_channel=PhoenixAnkaa" target="_blank">videography</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv0bvP2xezk&ab_channel=PhoenixAnkaa" target="_blank">choreographing dance routines with animations</a>, 
            3D modeling in Blender, designing 3D embossed textures, photography, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=888pXQmJZqo&ab_channel=PhoenixAnkaa" target="_blank">maintaining my simulation in Second Life</a>.</p>  
           <p>The virtual environment has inspired me to learn coding and explore further into technology. The virtual format has been my stepping stone as a creator.  It's hard to be in the Virtual World and attend school, so often I research topics such as  
            JavaScript methods, algorithms, and blockchain technologies to enhance my knowledge.   Blockchain is the new frontier and one of the areas that has caught my attention.</p>
